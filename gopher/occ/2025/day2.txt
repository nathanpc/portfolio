OCC 2025 (Day 2) Not Much
=========================

I'm writing this on day 3 for reasons that will become apparent in the next
sentence.

Sadly an unexpected trip to work for a meeting turned into an entire day of
work, up until 22h, meaning I wasn't able to even touch any of my retro
computers for the entire day, and by the time I got home I was so exausted that
I decided to call it a day and have a good night of sleep.

My parents are traveling from Brazil to visit us in Portugal on day 3, so I
guess it will also be a full day talking to my parents that I haven't seen in a
year.

Since most likely I won't be able to do any retro computing on day 3, I'll force
myself instead to have a day without technology, enjoying the time with my
parents as much as possible. After all OCC isn't just about old computers, it
can also be about no computers. :)
