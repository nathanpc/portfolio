OCC 2025 (Day -1) Preparation and Disaster
==========================================

Since this year I wasn't sure I was going to have time for OCC, because of work
and my parents visiting me in Portugal, I had not prepared myself beforehand for
the challenge, much like last year, when I learned about it while it was
happening by complete accident [1], although today I got word that I would have
most of the week off, meaning I could join in on the fun!

The first machine I thought of using this year was a brand new (to me) iBook G4
(Mid-2005) [2] that I bought for cheap (50 euros) 3 weeks ago, so I jumped right
into it and torn the entire thing down to replace the aging hard drive on the
thing with a nice SSD replacement [3]. I was so happy with it that I even
decided to record the entire disassembly and HDD replacement process, with
commentary and everything.

3 hours later and completely reassembling the iBook back together, I went to
turn it on to install OS X 10.5 Leopard, and to my surprise, the new hard drive
wasn't recognized by Disk Utility. I tried everything, including some Open
Firmware magic, and even trying OpenBSD, nothing worked. Throughly frustrated,
I decided to completely scrap my these plans and pivot to another machine.

The machine I eventually settled on was last year's PowerBook G4 [1]. A machine
I almost didn't use, since I was having too much fun with my Power Mac G5, and
got sidetracked by unsigned into playing with netbooks [4]. I guess I'll be
joining forces with andreixyz [5].

The good thing about this machine is that it's already setup and I can just
start having fun right away, which is great! Although I still don't have a goal
for this year, let's see what I can come up with tomorrow.

I recently (last week) got a brand new Pocket 386 laptop [6], so I guess it may
also come into play this year, specially since I have already used it to take
notes in meetings this week.

I hope everyone has an amazing time during OCC 2025! See you all on IRC!
