OCC 2025 (Day 3) No Technology Challenge
========================================

As I have discussed on my post for the second day, today was supposed to be a
day without technology, where I would simply enjoy the company of my parents
that had arrived to visit us in Portugal for a month.

Apart from some quick interruptions due to work, I was able to stay away from
technology and enjoy quite a nice time with my parents. Staying away from my
phone and only checking the work email every 2 hours (and only during work
hours) helped a lot.

It's quite nice to get a break from the constant frenzy of information that we
are exposed to on a daily basis, and go back to a time when we simply enjoyed
being alive. I can truly understand the peace that old folks have after this
experience.

I guess this peace of not using technology strikes close to what we feel when we
are in our old computers. With them we are not constantly being bombarded by ads
and notifications, we are living more patiently, since the machines we are using
aren't responding immediately to our commands, letting us have some time to
think and work in our own pace, not constantly feeling pressured by the speed of
our overpowered workstations.

What a great day!
