filled with useless information, served to you in glorious plain text!

i--- About me -----------------------------------------------------------------	header null 0

I'm a full-stack developer, creative technologist, and an electronics engineer
born in rainy Brazil and currently living in sunny Portugal. You can find me
working on almost anything that involves electricity, both in terms of
hardware and software.  Building things has always been a passion of mine, so
you'll notice that I'm always self-motivated to work on new projects that
involve technology. Some of the things that I've worked on have been used by
hundreds of thousands of people, maybe into the millions depending on who's
counting, and my work has definitely reached at least tens of millions.

I'm currently dedicating some of my time to passing some of my knowledge to
another generation and having a lot of fun working on creative projects with
my students and colleagues at IADE - Creative University, where I'm the course
coordinator of the bachelor's in Computer Engineering, but I'm also involved
with the bachelor's in Creative Technologies, Games Development, and the
master's in Creative Computing and Artificial Intelligence.

If you browse through my website, or my company's website, you'll notice that
I'm capable of building quite a lot of amazing things. If you're looking for
someone with my skillset either for your company or to make your idea become a
reality feel free to reach out to me.

1Various ways to contact me	/contact

i--- Hanging out --------------------------------------------------------------	header null 0

I may be inviting weirdos into my life, but if you're ever around Lisbon,
contact me and we can probably arrange to hang out somewhere and awkwardly
talk about technology.

If you prefer to hang out with me, and other like-minded people that love
plain text and older technology without the awkwardness of being physically in
the same room, you can find me hanging out (mostly on weekends) at
h#oldcomputerchallenge on Libera.Chat's IRC server	URL:https://web.libera.chat/gamja/#oldcomputerchallenge

i--- More from me on the web --------------------------------------------------	header null 0

Although I love the simplicity of Gopher, I do have a much larger presence on
the web, although differently from almost everyone I still make all my
websites available through plain HTTP and ensure that they are as compatible
with older browsers as possible.
