<p>Today was marked by a lot of progress in the <a href="https://github.com/nathanpc/rodent">
Gopher client</a>. I was able to get it to a point where it can easily parse
entire directories knowing each item's data type. It's now at a point where all
that's left to do is implement a browsing stack, enabling users to go back and
forth in history, something that's relatively easy to implement (it's a simple
stack, not a tree). After the stack gets implemented I'll be ready to move to
the UI implementation phase, which will probably take place first on Windows,
since I'm a lot more confortable with the Win32 API. Since the Eee PC is finally
ready to go it'll probably be my main development machine for the first
implementation of the client.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Eee PC, it spent the whole day getting Office 2010, Visual
Visual Studio 2010, and 216 Windows updates installed. Getting from a fresh
install of Windows 7 to a fully updated one is an ordeal these days, specially
since many of them fail, due to dependencies on previous updates, making the
whole process even more tedious and cumbersome, leaving me feeling as an admin

recovering from the CrowdStrike fiasco</a>.</p>

	'Had to reboot multiple times to get all of them to install sucessfully') ?>

<p>Today was also the day when many of the participants in the challenge
finished their journey, many of them will stick around IRC and due to the
creation of the <a href="http://bb.deadnet.se/">phpBB forums</a> I do believe
the community may stick together for longer. For me I'll still continue until
Monday, but to be honest, after this amazing experience, I'll probably continue
indefinitely, only breaking out modern machines when needed, let's see if I can
in fact keep this up.</p>
