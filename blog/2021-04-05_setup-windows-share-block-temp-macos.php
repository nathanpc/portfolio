<p>
	If you've ever had an Apple computer or has worked with someone that uses
	one you're more than likely familiar with the infamous
	<code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store">.DS_Store</a></code>,
	<code><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1067054/what-is-the-point-of-the-trashes-file-in-mac-os-x">.Trashes</a></code>,
	and other files that macOS leaves absolutely everyone. These files are akin
	to <code><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_thumbnail_cache">Thumbs.db</a></code>,
	and <code><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/why-are-there-two-desktopini-files-my-desktop-what-do-they-do/">desktop.ini</a></code>
	on Windows, they are used by the operating system as either cache,
	temporary/special storage, or as a way to store special attributes that are
	not natively supported by the underlying filesystem. They are, for the most
	part, completely optional, and shouldn't be hanging around your file server,
	littering your folders and causing confusion. Thankfully deleting and
	blocking these files from being created is quite a trivial task under
	Windows Server if you have the
	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/fsrm/fsrm-overview">
	File Server Resource Manager</a> role installed.
</p>

<p>
	Before we begin, make sure that you have the FSRM role installed in your
	file server by going to the <code>Server Manager</code> and selecting the
	<code>File and Storage Services &gt; File and iSCSI Services &gt; File
	Server Resource Manager</code> role from the <code>Add Roles and Features
	Wizard</code> like this:
</p>

<?= $this->image('Add-Roles-and-Features-Wizard.png', 'Installing FSRM role using the GUI', [], [
	'caption' => true
]) ?>

<p>
	Alternatively if you're running
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Core">Windows Server Core</a>,
	like I am in this case, you can install this role by running the following
	PowerShell command:
</p>

<?php compat_code_begin('powershell'); ?>Install-WindowsFeature -Name FS-Resource-Manager -IncludeManagementTools<?php compat_code_end(); ?>

<p>
	After you have everything installed and properly setup let's focus our
	attention to the files that we want to block/remove from our network shares.
	The most common ones that are created by macOS are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>._*</code></li>
	<li><code>.DS_Store</code></li>
	<li><code>.Trashes</code> (Directory)</li>
	<li><code>.TemporaryItems</code> (Directory)</li>
	<li><code>.apdisk</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
	All of these files are completely optional and can be blocked from being
	created without any problems to the users of your network shares. From here
	you can block the files from this list using the GUI or PowerShell by
	<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/fsrm/file-screening-management">
	following this tutorial from Microsoft</a> or, since this is quite a tedious
	task, run my PowerShell script to setup all of the file screening rules and
	delete any of these files that are already in your network shares. This way
	you can easily set this up even on Server Core installations, which is the
	case of my file server.

<p>
	When you run this script please remember to specify the network share that
	you want to setup the file screening in (e.g. <code>.\Block-FsrmMacJunk.ps1
	E:\Shares</code>), but don't worry that the script will throw an error and
	remind you of this in case you forget. The script will also ask if you want
	to delete any of these files that might already be in your network shares.
