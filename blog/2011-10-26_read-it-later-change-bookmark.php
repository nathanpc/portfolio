<p>
	I know, <a href="http://readitlaterlist.com/">Read it Later</a> wasn't
	designed to compete with social bookmarking sites or just bookmarking sites,
	but I think of it as bookmarks 2.0, a list of not only links with names, but
	a list of offline content that I can read everywhere! I've bought it three
	days ago an I just can't stop using it.
</p>

<p>
	I had a big problem with my Galaxy Tab and my other Android devices: If I
	was browsing the web using the default browser and for some reason I had to
	turn off the device, all my tabs get lost. So I was searching for some tool
	that could help me with this and I came across Read It Later. It's a lot
	more than I had in mind, it synchronizes between my iPhone, iPad, Galaxy
	Tab, Android devices and my Mac! And also store a cleaner version of the
	website offline, just like the Reader feature in iOS 5's Mobile Safari.
</p>

<p>
	With a great UI on mobile devices and now with a great UI on the web
	version, it's great to have all your important web sites that you might need
	to read in another device or maybe later, all in one organized and secure
	place.
</p>

<p>
	I was trying to find the favorite feature in the mobile version of the
	service, but I haven't found anything, maybe it's because this features are
	still in beta on the web version and will come out soon.
</p>

<p>
	If you browse the web in many different mobile devices or if you like to
	have a little archive of the best pages you read, this is for sure an app
	made for you! I recommend it to everyone.
