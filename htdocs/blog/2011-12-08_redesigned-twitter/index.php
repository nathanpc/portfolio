		<h2>A Faster, Simpler and Redesigned Twitter</h2>

<p>
	The Twitter developer team has been busy in the last months preparing the
	new version of the most popular micro-blogging tool. Just some minutes ago
	their blog got a new post with a link to a page about the redesign.
</p>

<p>
	For sure a lot of people will be angry at the beginning, just like happened
	with the #NewTwitter, but with some time they will start to love it. This
	new update will make Twitter a lot better for you to know what your friends
	are doing, people that are interacting with you and to discover new people
	to follow. Looks like it will finally be in real-time, as I can tell from
	the video they've posted (which will be attached on the bottom of this
	post), so you won't need to click on that bar at the top to show the new
	updates.
</p>

<p>
	With a new web interface, they are also going to update the mobile apps for
	Android and iOS to take advantage of the new features (looks like the
	Blackberry fans will need to wait).
</p>

<p>
	In my opinion this new update is the best move the company could ever made.
	This new version is also going to make Twitter look a lot more like a real
	social network which seems to me the future of Twitter. For sure they will
	implement more privacy features (like Circles on Google+) in the next
	versions.

	I want to finish this article by congratulating the entire Twitter team for
	the great job they are doing with their platform and how great they are for
	the open source community.
