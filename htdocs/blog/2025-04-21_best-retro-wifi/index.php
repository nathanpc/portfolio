		<h2>Best Wi-Fi router solution for retro computers</h2>

<p>
	If you're into retro computers, you will eventually want to connect them to
	your local network to browse <a href="https://theoldnet.com">The Old
	Internet</a> or simply to easily transfer files between your modern
	machines, or a NAS, and your retro rig without the hassle of removable
	media.
</p>

<p>
	If the retro device that you're connecting to your network has an a wired
	RJ-45 port for Ethernet, then it's as simple as connecting the machine to
	your switch and you're good to go, but if your machine is quite old and the
	only available option is Wi-Fi, such is the case with Palmtops or handheld
	gaming devices, you will quickly realize that these devices either don't
	support the newer wireless standards, requiring
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003">802.11g</a> or
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11b-1999">802.11b</a>, or
	they can only authenticate using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_Equivalent_Privacy">WEP</a>
	or the first generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">WPA</a>,
	both of which are deprecated and most wireless routers, including smartphone
	hotspots, won't even allow you to select as an option for protection.
</p>

<p>
	These limitations greatly reduce the enjoyment that you can get out of some
	of your old devices, and for years I had an old access point configured with
	WEP that I turned on whenever I wanted to play with a device that needed
	WiFi, which was always cumbersome, since I had to plug it in and remember to
	plug it back off when I was finished, since leaving such a device on would
	be a security nightmare for my home network, so I always wanted to find a
	solution to this problem, and I think I found the perfect one.
</p>

<p>
	For <a href="https://www.amazon.es/dp/B00TQEX8BO">~25â‚¬ on Amazon.es</a> you
	can purchase a <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/wifi-router/tl-wr802n/">TP-Link
	Nano TL-WR802N</a> wireless router. A tiny square access point that is
	<a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr802n_v4">fully supported by
	OpenWRT</a> (even the latest revision of the hardware, v4 as of 2025-04-21),
	meaning we can unlock its full potential and have proper control over this
	tiny device.
</p>

<p>
	My goal for the perfect retro wireless router was something that I could
	leave turned on all the time, supported my old devices, including the ones
	that require 802.11b, required no authentication, since I had issues with
	WEP in the past, and blocked all non-authorized devices. All tasks that can
	easily be accomplished with OpenWRT and a MAC address allowlist.

<p>
	The first step on this journey was to flash <a href="https://openwrt.org/start">OpenWRT</a>
	onto the router, which wasn't a simple task, since the only way to do it was
	to netboot it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol">TFTP</a>,
	a method that I've always had mixed results with in the past. The
	<a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wr802n_v4#installation">instructions
	found in the OpenWRT wiki</a> were helpful, but I wasn't able to get it to
	work with the default static IP described there, instead I used the
	parameters found on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/openwrt/comments/m8le8v/openwrt_tplink_tlwr802n_need_installation_help/grtzg5i/">this
	Reddit comment</a>.
</p>

<p>
	I was on a Mac, so I had to use <a href="https://kin.klever.net/pumpkin/">PumpKIN</a>
	as my TFTP server which, despite my past experiences with TFTP, worked
	flawlessly, and I was able to flash the router after many tries with
	different network settings.

		array('loc' => './pumpkin-settings.png', 'alt' => 'PumpKIN TFTP server settings'),
		array('loc' => './pumpkin-flashing.png', 'alt' => 'PumpKIN serving the OpenWRT firmware')
	))

<p>
	After the initial configuration of OpenWRT, setting it up to use my DHCP
	server and other things specific to my network, the only thing left to do
	was to setup the access point so that my old devices could freely connect to
	it. The following settings were used for this purpose:
</p>

<?= compat_image('./openwrt-ssid.png', 'OpenWRT wireless network settings') ?>

<p>
	After enabling the network, the last thing to do was to go to the
	<code>MAC-Filter</code> tab and add the MAC addresses of all my old devices,
	ensuring that only the devices listed on that section would be able to
	connect to the access point, without any password or security required,
	ensuring the maximum amount of compatibility while still keeping my home
	network secure.
</p>

<p>
	I've been using this setup for the past week and it has worked flawlessly so
	far. All my retro devices connect instantly to it. The only aspect that I
	still need to improve on it is a way to easily add MAC addresses to the
	allowlist without having to manually look them up on the device and enter it
	using the web interface. Maybe I'll eventually write a script that gets the
	OpenWRT access logs and adds the last device that tried to connect to it to
	the allowlist, or something like this. If I ever get around to developing a
	solution for this I'll surely post about it.
