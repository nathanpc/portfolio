<p>
	Over the past couple of years, I've been growing increasingly disgusted at
	the current state of the web in general where every website that you visit
	takes way too long to load, is filled with trackers and ads that I have to
	block, uses more CPU than a real application, and generally feels like a
	scam website from around 2008.
</p>

<p>
	Adding to this feeling was the fact that I've always wanted to build my own
	personal website and get rid of my <a href="https://about.me/nathanpc">
	about.me profile</a>, which I used as the landing page of this domain
	because I'm lazy and I didn't want to allocate time to build a website.
</p>

<p>
	When last year's about.me premium plan renewal came I decided to cancel it
	to force myself to build the website that I've always wanted to, but because
	I live a hectic life, almost an entire year later, I've finally allocated
	some time to build this, and it's everything that I've ever wanted.
</p>

<p>
	It's built with PHP, available on
	<a href="https://github.com/nathanpc/portfolio">GitHub</a>, and is tested on
	Internet Explorer 5. It's the pinnacle of what I believe a website should
	look and feel. It's exactly like the websites I used to visit when I was
	trying to learn everything that I could about computers back in the early
	2000s.
